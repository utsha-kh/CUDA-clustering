# ImageSegmentation-with-CUDA
A GUI application to perform image segmentation, using "k-means clustering", an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

Planned order of implementation :

    1.Implement the algorithm in regular C++
    2.Modify code to deploy CUDA cores
    3.Implement image segmentation in C++
    4.Modify code to deploy CUDA cores 
    5.Add GUI and think about othre stuffs.
