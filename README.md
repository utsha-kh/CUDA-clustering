# ImageSegmentation-with-CUDA
A GUI application to perform image segmentation, using "k-means clustering", an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

Planned order of implementation :

    1.Load image
    2.Implement the algorithm in regular C++
    3.Modify code to deploy CUDA cores
    4.Add GUI and think about othre stuffs.
