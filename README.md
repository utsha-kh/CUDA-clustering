# ImageSegmentation-with-CUDA
A GUI application to perform image segmentation, using "k-means clustering", an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

Planned order of implementation :

    1.Implement the algorithm in regular C++ : done    
    2.Modify code to deploy CUDA cores : done
    3.Implement image segmentation in C++
    4.Modify code to deploy CUDA cores 
    5.Add GUI and think about othre stuffs. 
    

Now, thinking to add following functionalities:
    1. auto-calibration of k value
    2. make the UI easier
